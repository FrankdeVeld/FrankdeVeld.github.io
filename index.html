        <h1>Frank de Veld</h1>
	<p>
		I am Frank de Veld, currently a third year PhD student at Université Côte d'Azur, but working mostly with INRIA and Thales Alenia Space. I am mostly specialised in satellite trajectory optimisation, with research topics including low-thrust collision avoidance, debris removal with solar sailing, and interplanetary transfers.
		My studies also covered a variety of other science and engineering topics, such as planetary sciences, space systems engineering, numerical modelling, quantum physics and dynamical systems. I like to perform independent and collaborative research on space-related topics.
		I have been Lead Rover Engineer for TU Delft student team <a href="https://zebro.tudelft.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lunar Zebro</a> for 1 year, worked as a research intern in the <a href="https://sea-level.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">geology research lab of Queen's University</a>, and launched the space sustainability start-up <a href="https://www.ecosmic.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ecosmic</a>, which together with my academic background have prepared me for professional life in the space industry.
		Apart from these rather technical topics, I like to write blog articles about topics like space sustainability and space exploration, but also physics: I wrote about <a href="https://spacegeneration.org/space-tourism-a-closer-look-on-safety-sustainability" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">space tourism</a>, <a href="https://www.nnv.nl/archief/pdf/1401/44/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entrepeneurship</a> and <a href="https://www.ntvn.nl/media/files/Student_mei_2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lunar rovers</a>, to give an idea.
		Currently, I mostly work in Julia and Python for large projects and day-to-day tasks, but I have experience in C++, R, MatLab and Java as well and an open for new learning opportunities.

		If you are interested in collaboration or know of any interesting opportunities, feel free <a href="mailto:frankdeveld@gmail.com">to reach out!</a>
