            It is common practice to perform uncontrolled re-entry of large objects, which will not completely burn up in the atmosphere

            Not quite like the 'Great Pacific Garbage Patch' (45 000 - 129 000 tons)

            Comparison with 'natural' re-entry and its risks: man-made re-entry is still minor, of less risk and can be controlled

            On March 8th, a battery pack of the ISS re-entered in the atmosphere, weighing 2600 kg  <a href="https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Space_Debris/Reentry_of_International_Space_Station_ISS_batteries_into_Earth_s_atmosphere">[1]</a> Not much before, the decommissioned ERS-2 satellite, weighing 2500 kg, re-entered on February 21st in the Pacific Ocean <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Heritage_ERS-2_satellite_to_reenter_Earth_s_atmosphere">[2]</a>. Re-entry for both of these objects was uncontrolled, meaning that their trajectories could not be changed after the end of mission of the satellite or the release of the batteries. Since then, many years have passed, making it impossible to predict beforehand where and when the objects would re-enter into the atmosphere and (partially) burn up.

            In the past few years, the European Space Agency has put much attention into safe disposal of satellites and performs re-entry analysis of uncontrolled and controlled de-orbits of satellites and space debris objects. Their main goal is to estimate the casualty risk or risk of property damage due to falling space debris, with an acceptable threshold set at 1 in 10.000. We are mostly saved by the fact that most of the Earth surface is uninhabited - after all, most of it is ocean, and space operators try to aim decommissioned spacecraft at the Pacific Ocean, which alone is larger than all land masses combined. Only one person has ever been (harmlessly) hit by a piece of space debris

            Nevertheless, many incidents, close calls and minor damage
