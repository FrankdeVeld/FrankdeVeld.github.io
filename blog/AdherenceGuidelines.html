        Where Earth's orbital space was once a 'Wild West', more and more regulations are starting to be put into place with more and more players entering the market. Space is like Earth's oceans, or Antarctica: in principle a common heritage for mankind, but also littered with claims of nations and companies. New players have to fit in the complex network of existing satellite constellations, rocket launches and space stations. However, for most of Earth's orbits, this puzzle continues to work out and new pieces can still be added, as space is vast. There will be more dangerous encounters and a need to regulate the space traffic, but adding another satellite to the collection is often just a matter of finding the right orbit

        The geosynchronous region is different. This region is space has the special property that objects stationed here have roughly the same rotation period as the Earth, meaning they are appear fixed in the sky. The special properties of this region make it a valuable asset - and most importantly a limited one. Contrary to other regions in space, the usage of the geosynchronous region is tightly controlled by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), an UN agency which has divided the region into orbital slots according to their latitude, dividing the ring into a few hundred parts. This division leaves satellites still far away from each other: the main reason for the large separation is to avoid communication interference, rather than avoiding physical collisions. While satellite can in principle share an orbital slot, the geosynchronous region is practically filled to the brim.

        The geosynchronous region, just like the low-Earth orbit region, is a protected orbital region according to the IADC space debris mitigation guidelines, meaning that all satellites have to be removed within 25 years of their end-of-life. Unlike in LEO, these guidelines are usually adhered to in the geosynchronous region. Satellite operators move satellites towards a 'graveyard orbit' several hundred kilometers above the geosynchronous region with left-over propellant. They even sign binding agreements with national governments about these clean-ups, like Dish Network did for their satellite EchoStar-7 in 2012. However, in the end of 2022, the satellite was left without fuel while it was halfway its journey to the graveyard orbit. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), a US organisation handling these affairs, has now fined Dish Network $150.000 for their failed satellite removal, a world's first.
