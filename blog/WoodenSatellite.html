            On November 5th, 2024, Kyoto University launched its 'LignoSat' in partnership with Sumitomo Forestry, the first satellite made primarily out of wood, instead of traditional aluminium structures. Even the assembly required no screws or bolts, as the team used a traditional Japanese crafts technique to lock all parts into each other with nothing but the honoki wood, the same material traditionally used for sword sheaths. Unfortunately, this is where the novelty of the satellite ended, as the satellite never established communication with the ground station.

            This satellite is more than just showmanship. Satellites are typically made out of exotic alloys composed of various light-weight metals such as aluminium and titanium, as these are sturdy, keep down launch costs, and are relatively cheap on their own. However, what comes up, also will come down at some point. As of 2025, more than 1 million kg of mass is launched into space each year <a href="https://www.spacefoundation.org/2024/01/23/the-space-report-2023-q4/">[1]</a>. To reduce accumulation of space debris, the widely accepted policy is to remove satellites and rockets from orbit when their mission has ended. However, we don't literally bring these objects back to Earth - instead, we usually count on the atmosphere to act as a 'garbage collector' and let these objects burn up through an uncontrolled re-entry. Our atmosphere luckily is dense and high enough to let most objects burn up completely, but that does not mean they disappear. Instead, they vaporise and mix with the (upper) regions of the atmosphere, which typically do not contain much metal (source needed). While the amount of material injected in the atmosphere is 'only' in the order of 1 million kg per year, it has caused concern for some researchers.

            In 2019, ESA initiated a study with Varuna and Thales Alenia Space about assessing the impact of satellite burn-up in the atmosphere, looking mostly at ozone depletion and radiative forcing effects, the possible effects of metal presence on solar energy reflection. Their conclusion was that the effect of a single re-entry event on the atmosphere is in all metrics quite low, only significant in the polar regions, which do not see many re-entry events <a href="https://blogs.esa.int/cleanspace/2022/08/11/on-the-atmospheric-impact-of-spacecraft-demise-upon-reentry/">[2]</a>.  However, it was noted that we really don't have the appropriate data yet; we don't study re-entry events all that much, and especially not from close-by, with direct atmospheric measurements at high altitude (indeed, the prospect of the observation balloon being pierced by space debris is not appealing). More worryingly however is that the 'worst-case' scenario of the ESA study included about 300 re-entry events per year. Currently, we see more than 3000 satellites launched each year, most of which re-entering within the next 10 years, and this number is unlikely to be reduced. One satellite burning up might not have too much of an effect, but several thousands each year sounds more problematic.

            Indeed, ESA organised a follow-up workshop in 2024 about this topic <a href="https://indico.esa.int/event/493/timetable/?view=standard_inline_minutes">[3]</a>. Recent findings showed that already 10% of stratospheric particles contained metals originating from burned-up spacecraft. These small particles can contribute to mesospheric and stratospheric cloud nucleation of ice or nitric acid trihydrate, and with that (mostly polar) weather. We simply don't know enough yet about the impact of these extra particles in the stratosphere, and how quickly they are naturally removed from the atmosphere. One event in 1964 was valuable however; a failed navigational satellite caused a release of plutonium in the atmosphere (another material which we definitely_don't want to see too much in our atmosphere). Due to its radioactivity, the debris could be accurately tracked worldwide. Still, research which does not involve scattering radioactive debris through the air is needed and necessary. 

            The amount of satellite and rocket mass entering our atmosphere is still much smaller than the amount of meteor material, by a factor 10 approximately. However, meteors emit much less material due to their high speeds, and tend to contain much fewer potentially dangerous materials. Together with the dramatic rise of satellite launches, the satellites and rockets burning up form significant emissions. However, apart from researching their effects, what can we do with this knowledge? Are wooden satellites the answer? Space is a harsh environment, where materials need to sustain temperature variations of over 200 degrees Celsius every day, as well as vacuum and space radiation. On the other hand, wood will not rot as on Earth, due to the lack of water, oxygen and bacteria in space, and wood is a cheap material compared to the cutting-edge technology of spaceflight. During re-entry, wood on the other hand would burn excellently and quickly, with few dangerous emissions, and reducing the risk that a satellite would not completely burn up and hit someplace on Earth instead. It might even provide an unexpected benefit, as wood does not interfere with electromagnetic waves of internal components; though this also means there is less shielding from external radiation.

            Still, LignoSat is not completely made out of wood; it still has aluminium inner structures and standard electronic components. While we know that it survived launch (not an easy task with the vibrations during the process!), we unfortunately cannot obtain valuable data about the performance of the wooden 'space bus' due to the communication failure. Tests on the ISS which included exposure of the wood to space conditions were promising however, showing that wood in principle can be a viable material for satellites. A follow-up (LignoSat-2) is planned for potentially 2026, but in the meantime, the original wooden satellite is now sadly not much more than space debris itself. While the idea of a real 'space-ship' made of wood sounds like something of a steampunk movie, is it unlikely that wood will become a commonplace material for human-rated structures, as zero risks are taken for astronaut missions.
